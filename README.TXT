PROJECT TITLE: SKYRIM
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To be an adventurer and explore, like you do in skyrim
VERSION or DATE: v1

AUTHORS: Aidan James
USER INSTRUCTIONS: You spawn into the game and to be able to be let into the town, 
                    you have to slay the goblin and then the twon gaurd will let you in,
                    but in order to do so, it would be a good idea to heal at the riverbank
                    and obtain a long sword.
